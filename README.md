## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- **User and agency registration and authentication:** Tourists can sign up to request more information, and travel agencies can register their profiles and tour offerings.
- **Store information in a database:** Includes user and agency data, regional details, tour information, payments, and agency-user chats.
- **Image upload and email notifications:** Users can upload profile pictures, receive notifications when creating an account, and get notified of pending messages after booking a tour.
- The app must include at least one of the following features:
  - **Payments:** Secure booking transactions, similar to platforms like Airbnb.
  - **Tourist information map:** Display a map with pre-established tourist spots.
  - **Real-time communication (WebSockets):** Implement a live chat feature for users to communicate with agencies.

## Our Process

- **Sprint 1:** Brainstorming ideas for the project, creating a visual sitemap using [Octopus.do](https://share.octopus.do/embed/ddn3ssxynzh), and setting up the product backlog in Jira.
- **Sprint 2:** Designing the system (fonts, colors, icons with `lucide-react`), setting up the project with Vite and React using TypeScript + SWC, and configuring tools like Prettier, ESLint, Husky, lint-staged, commitlint, and pnpm. Additionally, setting up the GitHub repository with Gitflow, developing the initial components (some adapted from Shadcdn), and setting up page routing using React Router.
- **Sprint 3:** Updating the README, mocking API requests using `json-server`, and improving UX (dark mode, form enhancements).
